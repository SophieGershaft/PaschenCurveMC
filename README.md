# Paschen Curve MC Simulation

Welcome to the Paschen Curve MC Simulations GitHub Repo! 
In this repo, we keep all of our up-to-date Mathematica and Java code for our MC simulations. 
Mathematica code has been written by William and Java code has been written by Sophie.

## Project Info

Since the Spring of 2021, we have been working on MC Simulations of electrical breakdown in IEC Fusion devices in order to better understand plasma creation in our experimental fusion reactor setup. We have explored breakdown for parallel plate, concentric-sphere, and sphere-in-cylinder geometries (all of which can be seen in the code here). Dr. Charles Whitmer and Gunnar Mein have been advisors during the project. We are currently writing a research paper which we plan to publish this Summer.
